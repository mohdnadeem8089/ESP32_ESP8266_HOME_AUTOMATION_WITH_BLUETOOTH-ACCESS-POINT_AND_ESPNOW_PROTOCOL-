IN THIS PROJECT I GONNA MAKE A CIRCUIT FOR HOME AUTOMATION, WE CAN CONTROL 16 CHANNERL HOME appliance WITH BLUETTOTH, ACCESS POINT AND ESPNOW, IN THIS PROJECT I USE ESP32 AT MASTER SIDE AND ESP8266 AT SLAVE SIDE AND FOR MULTIPLE GPIO I USE MCP23017 IO EXPENDER, 16 SPST RELAY FOR CONTROLLING APPLIANCE YOU CAN FIND SCHEMATIC IN CIRCUIT AND ALSO TO DESIGN PCB I USE KICAD 9, YOU CAN FIND SAMPLE CODE FOR THIS WITHOUT MCP23017 FOR PROTOTYPING IN THAT CODE YOU CAN CONTROL RELAY VIA BLUETOOTH ACCESS POINT BOTH SLAVE MASTER AND ALSO YOU CAN CONTROL WITH REMOTE THAT USE ESPNOW PROTOCOL, ALSO YOU CAN FIND KICAD 9 FILES FOR PCB AND INO FILE FOR thanks for reading
